# Sudoku-Full-Stack Client
Coding problem to cover different aspect of full stack
This part is specifically for front-end.

To run this service we need to install nodejs.

It better begins for server (it is in the other repository).

After the server is running, to run level 2 and 3 of client side (front-end) we need:
- Make sure nodejs is installed and then you just need to type: 
    $npm run superstart
    It is going to install all dependecies, build the project and run the client server

To run level 4... coming soon too! ;)
